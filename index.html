<h2>About Me</h2> 
  I am Nicholas Dixon, welcome to my digital portfolio! I am a Writing and Rhetoric major with passion for learning about language, digital culture, and creative expression. Outside of academics, I like being outside, whether I am hiking, swimming, or even just sitting. I am excited to learn more about digital humanities from this course, it is one of the first courses I've taken outside of the Writing and Rhetoric department.
